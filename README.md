# ML-AI Elevvo Internship Projects

Welcome to my internship portfolio for the **Elevvo AI & Machine Learning Internship** — where I'm applying real-world data science and machine learning techniques to solve impactful problems.

This repository showcases my work on a series of ML/AI tasks designed to strengthen my hands-on experience in regression, classification, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

## ✅ Task 1: Predicting Student Exam Scores

🎯 **Goal:** Predict students’ final exam scores based on study habits and lifestyle factors using a dataset of 6,607 records.

📁 **Folder:** [`Task1_StudentScoreRegression`](./Task1_StudentScoreRegression)

### 📌 What I Explored
- 🔸 **Linear Regression** — Hours Studied vs Exam Score
- 🔸 **Polynomial Regression** — Degree 2 non-linearity
- 🔸 **Multi-Feature Regression** — Added features: sleep hours, tutoring, extracurriculars
- 🔸 **Feature Engineering** — Label encoding, one-hot encoding
- 🔸 **Model Evaluation** — MSE & R² Score
- 🔸 **Visualization** — Actual vs Predicted, Polynomial Fit, Feature Importance

### 📊 Results Summary

| Model                     | MSE    | R² Score |
|--------------------------|--------|----------|
| Linear Regression         | 10.86  | 0.23     |
| Polynomial Regression     | 10.84  | 0.23     |
| Multi-Feature Regression  | 3.26   | 0.77     |

🧠 **Key Insight:** Feature engineering and quality inputs improved model performance far more than increasing complexity.  
The final model explains **77%** of score variance!

### 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- Dataset: [Student Performance Factors (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

## 🧠 What's Next?

In upcoming tasks, I’ll:
- Explore **non-linear models** (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Build **classification models** (e.g., Loan Approval)
- Perform **model tuning** and interpretability analysis
- Possibly deploy or visualize results in a dashboard!
